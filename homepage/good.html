                <h3>Mandy Meindersma</h3>
                <p> I am a fourth year computing science student at the University of Alberta. I finally graduate in April 2019! I love yoga, cats and growing cacti. The world is full of opportunities and I aim to take advantage of as many as I can. I have been lucky to have a lot of internships through out my education.
                    I have learned a ton and they have helped me so much. Intuit is the reason I have my cool graduation timer above, we did a coding camp with kids and taught them how to make their own timers! I am excited for what ever comes next.
