# Assignment: CSS Hell
====================


# Notes about my assignment
I was a little confused on how many different css styles we were supposed to create so I created two different css styles and applied them to all 3 html files. (See the second_css_style folder)
</br>
</br>
I edited the html:
* removed old styling
* added a couple div tag wrappers
* previously the order of the html was: title, chapters, then actual book. I changed this to be: chapters, title, then actual book. I only did this for the first css styling, not for the second.
* adding a link tag in the head to get the css styling imported
* adding class names to some html tags
